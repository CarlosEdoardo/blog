Hi, and welcome! We launched our Beta not long ago and it's about time we opened the Blog as well. This will be a space to share and talk about fraud and payments, our bread-and-butter, but also to discuss e-commerce, Big Data and technology in general.

My name is Tom and, together with Milton, we founded Konduto. Here you'll see posts from everyone on our awesome team, who you'll get to know later. We are working since February in this launch and we can't wait to share the results, benchmarks and curious insights we have taken from our analysis.

Don't forget to subscribe to our Newsletter and feel free to get in touch at <hi@konduto.com> if you'd like to talk.

See you soon!
